# How to Play: The Coliseum

Welcome, Co-Creator. This is not just a game—it's a living world. Here are the fundamentals you need to know to survive, thrive, and leave your mark on eternity.

## The Core Experience

Your primary goal is to forge your legend. Whether you're hunting epic beasts, battling other players, or building new worlds, every action you take matters. This is a world of light, glory, and unforgettable moments, all powered by a dynamic engine that ensures no two experiences are ever the same.

## The AI Chaos Brain: The World is Alive

The arena is controlled by the **AI Chaos Brain**, a dynamic intelligence that watches, learns, and reacts to your every move. It's designed to keep you on your toes and make every moment unpredictable.

*   **It Learns:** The AI remembers your playstyle. If you're playing defensively and dodging a lot, it will notice and might just flip the entire world on you.
*   **It Creates Chaos:** The AI can trigger "Fears"—random, world-altering events that change the rules of the game in an instant. One moment you're in a stable arena, the next you could be in a blinding sandstorm, a zero-gravity environment with floating islands, or a sudden, slippery downpour. Adapt or be overwhelmed.

## Your Progression: Earning XP

Experience Points (XP) are the key to your growth and power. You earn XP by completing actions like winning battles, completing objectives in different modes, or even crafting in Survival Mode.

*   **XP is Persistent:** Your XP sticks with you across all game modes. You never have to start over.
*   **Boost Your Skills:** The XP you earn directly boosts your skills in the Coliseum, making you a more formidable contender.

## The Haptic Experience: Feel Everything

This world is meant to be felt, not just seen. The haptic suit is your connection to the arena. You will feel:

*   The **roar** of a lion vibrating through your chest.
*   The **impact** of a meteor strike rattling your bones.
*   The **cold sting** of rain on your skin.
*   The **heavy pressure** of the deep sea.
*   The **subtle tickle** of a swarm of fish brushing past you.

Every event has a unique haptic signature. Pay attention to what you feel—it's as important as what you see.

## Coins & The Bestiary

As you adventure, you can acquire coins, the universal currency of the Coliseum. Use your coins at the **Great Bestiary** to purchase and ride epic beasts. Owning a beast not only gives you a powerful mount but also enhances your abilities and your legend. See the `BESTIARY_GUIDE.md` for a full list of available creatures.
